# Predicting Geographic/Economic Location of Degree-Granting Postsecondary Institutions by Region
This project aims to explore whether there are discernable differences between postsecondary institutions' characteristics and student bodies in different regions in the US.

## Data
The data from this project was obtained through the Education Data Portal API via the Urban Institute. The goal of Urban Institute's project was to make education data easy to access and analyze for greater transparency and hopefully positive policy changes.

My project focused on the data available for postsecondary institutions only. I further subsetting the data for institutions that are degree-granting. The final dataset contains 4,102 institutions and information about those institutions and their student body in 2016.

* Integrated Postsecondary Educaton Data System (IPEDS)
     + Directory
     + Institional Characteristics
     + Applications, Admissions, and Enrollments
     + Headcount
* College Scorecard
     + Student Home and Neighborhood Characteristics
* Dependent Variable of Interest
     + Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Regions

## Considerations
* Class imbalance
* Missing data
* Too many variables
